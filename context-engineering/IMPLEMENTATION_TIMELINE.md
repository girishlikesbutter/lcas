# Implementation Timeline

This document tracks the chronological progression of features implemented using the Context Engineering workflow for the LCAS project.

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Task 01)
**01-surrogate-data-generator/** 
- **Date**: Early in project
- **Purpose**: Create the base script and DataGenerator class structure
- **What was built**: 
  - Command-line script with argparse
  - DataGenerator class that loads satellite models
  - Placeholder for data generation logic

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Task 02)
**02-sample-uniform-sphere/**
- **Date**: Following foundation
- **Purpose**: Implement uniform sphere sampling for sun directions
- **What was built**:
  - `sample_uniform_sphere()` function using Gaussian normalization
  - Comprehensive documentation of the mathematical method
  - Avoids pole clustering issue with naive spherical coordinates

### Phase 3: Shadow Calculations (Task 03)
**03-ray-tracing-adaptation/**
- **Date**: After sphere sampling
- **Purpose**: Add ray tracing capability for shadow calculations
- **What was built**:
  - Combined satellite mesh creation in `__init__`
  - `calculate_lit_fractions()` method for ray tracing
  - Determines which facets are lit vs shadowed

### Phase 4: Data Collection (Task 04) ✅ COMPLETED
**04-data-generation-loop/** 
- **Date**: July 23, 2025
- **Purpose**: Complete the data generation pipeline
- **What was built**:
  - Progress tracking with tqdm import and implementation
  - Data collection loop orchestrating all previous components
  - CSV output using numpy.savetxt (following LCAS patterns)
  - Proper column ordering for face data with consistent naming
  - Input validation and comprehensive error handling
  - Memory-efficient processing for large sample counts

### Phase 5: Neural Network Foundation (Task 05) ✅ COMPLETED
**05-surrogate-mlp-model/**
- **Date**: July 23, 2025
- **Purpose**: Create PyTorch neural network architecture for surrogate modeling
- **What was built**:
  - `SurrogateNet` PyTorch nn.Module class in `src/surrogate/model.py`
  - MLP architecture: 3→64→64→64→M neurons with ReLU and Sigmoid activations
  - Flexible constructor accepting input_size, hidden_size, output_size parameters
  - Device handling compatible with LCAS PyTorch patterns (automatic GPU/CPU detection)
  - Comprehensive input validation and error handling with detailed error messages
  - Factory functions for convenient model creation with device handling
  - Architecture inspection methods (get_architecture_info, get_device)
  - Google-style docstrings and logging integration following LCAS patterns
  - 25 comprehensive unit tests with 92% code coverage
  - Integration tests validating compatibility with surrogate_data_generator.py format
