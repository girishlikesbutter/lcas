## FEATURE:

Create a PyTorch nn.Module class for a surrogate model that predicts satellite face illumination fractions from sun vectors. The architecture should be a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with:

- Input Layer: 3 neurons (for sun vector x, y, z components)
- 3 Hidden Layers: Each with 64 neurons and ReLU activation
- Output Layer: M neurons (where M = number of conceptual faces) with sigmoid activation

The class should be flexible, accepting input_size, hidden_size, and output_size as constructor parameters. The sigmoid activation is critical to ensure outputs are between 0 and 1, matching the physical constraints of lit fractions.

Create the class as `SurrogateNet` in a new file `src/surrogate/model.py` that inherits from `torch.nn.Module` and implements the `forward(self, x)` method for the forward pass.

## EXAMPLES:

The following files provide patterns to follow:
- `src/illumination/pytorch_shadow_engine.py`: Shows PyTorch tensor operations and device handling patterns used in the LCAS project
- `generate_lightcurves_pytorch.py`: Demonstrates PyTorch model usage patterns and tensor processing in the codebase
- Existing LCAS modules in `src/` for proper import structure and documentation style

Key patterns to extract:
- PyTorch nn.Module class structure and inheritance
- Constructor parameter handling for flexibility
- Layer definition using torch.nn.Linear and torch.nn.ReLU
- Forward pass implementation with proper tensor flow
- Device handling and tensor operations consistent with LCAS patterns

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- The module should follow LCAS project structure and be placed in a new `src/surrogate/` directory
- Use proper Python type hints throughout the implementation
- Include comprehensive docstrings following the Google style used in the LCAS project
- The class should be flexible enough to handle different satellite models with varying numbers of conceptual faces
- Ensure the sigmoid activation on the output layer to constrain values to [0, 1] range
- The model should be compatible with the data format generated by `surrogate_data_generator.py` (3 input features for sun vector)
- Consider adding parameter initialization following PyTorch best practices
- The implementation should integrate well with the existing LCAS PyTorch patterns and device handling
- Add proper imports and module structure to support future expansion of surrogate modeling capabilities
